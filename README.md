# Little Test Programs
The goal of this project is to explore the dark corners of C and C++, and maybe one day other languages as well, such as D.

* Each source file is meant to be a self-sufficient little test program, independent from all others.

* Each source file starts with a comment with the name of the language feature, language standard that introduced it, relevant documentation links and possibly an in-depth description.

Unless noted otherwise, all source files require the latest versions of toolchains, supporting the latest language standard; at least C++11 and C99.
