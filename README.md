# Little Test Programs
The goal of this project is to explore the dark corners of C and C++, and maybe one day other languages as well.

* Each source file is meant to be a self-sufficient little test program, independent from all others.

* Each source file starts with a comment with the name of the language feature, language standard that introduced it, and relevant documentation links.

Unless noted otherwise, all source files require the latest versions of toolchains, supporting the latest language standard.
